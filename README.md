Today, you will implement the game Mastermind.
Easy? Sure, but did you already developed it in SQL? or Cobol?
Also, for each version of the Mastermind, you will have to write an “How to write a Mastermind in XXX?” blog post.
All these “How to” must be hosted in a Github page or in a Blog platform (WordPress, Jekyll, Drupal, etc.) that you will administrated per campus.

Requirements

* You are free of the number of columns, colors and turns.
* Each game can be one player (against a bot) or 2 players
